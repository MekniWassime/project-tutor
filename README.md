# TUTORHUB application

## Defenition

A web application called TUTORHUB. It enables mentors to schedule training sessions of any activity they're teaching or a certain provided service. Our application offers them the platform to overture their services and schedule sessions at a time interval. They can get paid for those sessions via the application. It also offers the means for clients to register and be added to any of the sessions, pay for certain of them, and always reserve more sessions anytime they want. The verification of the latter is approved using a QR code given once the registration is verified.
